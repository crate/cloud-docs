# How-To Guides


This is a collection of how-to guides for CrateDB Cloud. Learn how to manage
your cluster and organizations below. For the purposes of these guides,
we assume you interact with CrateDB Cloud by using the CrateDB
Cloud Console. Alternatively, you can use the command-line interface CrateDB
Cloud CLI, aka. {ref}`Croud <cloud-cli:index>`.


:::{note}
Not all operations supported by the CrateDB Cloud Console are also
available via Croud. Most importantly, clusters can only be deployed via
the CrateDB Cloud Console.
