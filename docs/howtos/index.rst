=============
How-To Guides
=============

This is a collection of how-to guides for CrateDB Cloud. For the purposes of
these guides, we assume you interact with CrateDB Cloud by using the CrateDB
Cloud Console. Alternatively, you can use the command-line interface CrateDB
Cloud CLI, aka. :ref:`Croud <cloud-cli:index>`.


.. NOTE::

    Not all operations supported by the CrateDB Cloud Console are also
    available via Croud. Most importantly, clusters can only be deployed via
    the CrateDB Cloud Console.
