assumed that you have a cluster up and running and can access the
Console.

## What is cluster suspension

Cluster suspension is a feature that enables you to temporarily pause
your cluster while retaining all its data. An example situation might be
that the project you\'re working on has been put on hold. The cost of
running a cluster is split into two parts: **Compute** and **Storage**.
The benefit here is that while the cluster is suspended, you are only
charged for the storage.
