# Create Organization

This is a guide on how to create a new organization in the CrateDB Cloud
Console. When you first signup in [CrateDB Cloud], your first organization will
be automatically created for you. However, there are scenarios where you may
want to create a new organization.

If you arrive at the Console for the first time, or if you have deleted
your last organization, you will have to create an organization to use
the CrateDB Cloud Console\'s functionality.

If you wish to create multiple organizations when you are already member
of one, the process is slightly different. This guide will outline both
methods.

## Create first organization

When you first access the CrateDB Cloud Console after signing up, you
will arrive at the Cluster overview page. You will also be informed,
that your first organization named \"My Organization\" has been created
for you.

## Create multiple organizations

If you are already in an organization and want to create another one, go
to the Account tab. Here you will see a list of all your organizations
and your [user
role](https://crate.io/docs/cloud/reference/en/latest/user-roles.html)
in them.

To create a new organization, click on *Create new organization* at the
top right above the organization list. When prompted, simply input the
name of your new organization and confirm by clicking *Create
organization*. To delete an organization, click the trashcan icon next
to the organization in the list.

:::{note}
By default, users can be part of a maximum of two organizations. If you need to
join more organizations, please contact [Crate.io support](https://cratedb.com/contact).
:::

To switch the active organization, click on the organization name in the
list. All organization and cluster management options displayed in the
CrateDB Cloud Console will then refer to that organization until you
switch organizations again.
