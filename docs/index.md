# CrateDB Cloud


## About

**CrateDB Cloud** is the fully-managed database as a service offering by
[CrateDB]. With CrateDB Cloud, you can deploy, monitor, back up, and scale
your clusters in the cloud â€“ without needing to worry about database
management.

CrateDB is a distributed and scalable open-source SQL database for storing and
analyzing massive amounts of data in near real-time, even with complex queries.
It is PostgreSQL-compatible, and based on Lucene.

Customers are operating CrateDB clusters that store information in the range of
billions of records, and terabytes of data, equally accessible without any
retrieval penalty on data point age.

Learn how to get started and make the most of your CrateDB cloud subscription
